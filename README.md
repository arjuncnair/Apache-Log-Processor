## Apache Access Logs Formatting:

Apache Access Logs that needs to be processed should be in the format mentioned below:

where:
- **%h** – Remote host (client IP address)
- **%l** – User identity, or dash, if none (often not used)
- **%u** – Username, via HTTP authentication, or dash if not used
- **%t** – Timestamp of when Apache received the HTTP request
- **\”%r\** – The actual request itself from the client
- **%>s** – The status code Apache returns in response to the request
- **%b** – The size of the request in bytes.
- \”%{Referer}i\” – Referrer header, or dash if not used  (In other words, did they click a URL on another site to come to your site)
